# i2pboted #

go implementation of i2pbote

(does not do anything yet come back later)

## Build

This project is 100% self contained and does not need your `$GOPATH` variable to be set:

    $ git clone https://github.com/majestrate/i2pboted/
    $ cd i2pboted 
    $ make

... BUT you can use `go get` if you want to:

    $ go get -u -v github.com/majestrate/i2pboted
